abstract = {Abstract A method of magnetic resonance image acquisition and reconstruction is described in which high imaging rates and fast reconstruction times are allowed. The acquisition is a modification of the basic FLASH sequence but with a restricted number N of phase encodings. The encodings are applied sequentially, periodically, and continuously. Images are formed by sliding a window of width N encodings along the acquired data and reconstructing an image for each position of the window. In general the acquisition time per image exceeds the time between successive images, and the method thus has a temporal lag. Experimental studies were performed with a dynamic phantom using 48 phase encodings and a TR of 20 ms, for an image acquisition time of about 1 s. The image display rate in the reconstructed sequence was 12.5 images/s, and the image sequence portrayed the motion of the phantom. Additional studies were done with 24 encodings. It is shown how the sliding window technique lends itself to high-speed reconstruction, with each newly acquired echo used to quickly update the image on display. The combination of the acquisition technique described and a hardware implementation of the reconstruction algorithm can result in realtime MR image acquisition and reconstruction. © 1988 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {Purpose Abdominal dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI suffers from motion-induced artifacts that can blur images and distort contrast-agent uptake curves. For liver perfusion analysis, image reconstruction with rigid-body motion correction (RMC) can restore distorted portal-venous input functions (PVIF) to higher peak amplitudes. However, RMC cannot correct for liver deformation during breathing. We present a reconstruction algorithm with deformable motion correction (DMC) that enables correction of breathing-induced deformation in the whole abdomen. Methods Raw data from a golden-angle stack-of-stars gradient-echo sequence were collected for 54 DCE-MRI examinations of 31 patients. For each examination, a respiratory motion signal was extracted from the data and used to reconstruct 21 breathing states from inhale to exhale. The states were aligned with deformable image registration to the end-exhale state. Resulting deformation fields were used to correct back-projection images before reconstruction with view sharing. Images with DMC were compared to uncorrected images and images with RMC. Results DMC significantly increased the PVIF peak amplitude compared to uncorrected images (P << 0.01, mean increase: 8\%) but not compared to RMC. The increased PVIF peak amplitude significantly decreased estimated portal-venous perfusion in the liver (P << 0.01, mean decrease: 8 ml/(100 ml·min)). DMC also removed artifacts in perfusion maps at the liver edge and reduced blurring of liver tumors for some patients. Conclusions DCE-MRI reconstruction with DMC can restore motion-distorted uptake curves in the abdomen and remove motion artifacts from reconstructed images and parameter maps but does not significantly improve perfusion quantification in the liver compared to RMC.},

abstract = {Purpose Physiological nuisance fluctuations (“physiological noise”) are a major contribution to the time-series signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) of functional imaging. While thermal noise correlations between array coil elements have a well-characterized effect on the image Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR0), the element-to-element covariance matrix of the time-series fluctuations has not yet been analyzed. We examine this effect with a goal of ultimately improving the combination of multichannel array data. Theory and Methods We extend the theoretical relationship between tSNR and SNR0 to include a time-series noise covariance matrix Ψt, distinct from the thermal noise covariance matrix Ψ0, and compare its structure to Ψ0 and the signal coupling matrix SSH formed from the signal intensity vectors S. Results Inclusion of the measured time-series noise covariance matrix into the model relating tSNR and SNR0 improves the fit of experimental multichannel data and is shown to be distinct from Ψ0 or SSH. Conclusion Time-series noise covariances in array coils are found to differ from Ψ0 and more surprisingly, from the signal coupling matrix SSH. Correct characterization of the time-series noise has implications for the analysis of time-series data and for improving the coil element combination process.

abstract = {Abstract MRI using receiver arrays with many coil elements can provide high signal-to-noise ratio and increase parallel imaging acceleration. At the same time, the growing number of elements results in larger datasets and more computation in the reconstruction. This is of particular concern in 3D acquisitions and in iterative reconstructions. Coil compression algorithms are effective in mitigating this problem by compressing data from many channels into fewer virtual coils. In Cartesian sampling there often are fully sampled k-space dimensions. In this work, a new coil compression technique for Cartesian sampling is presented that exploits the spatially varying coil sensitivities in these nonsubsampled dimensions for better compression and computation reduction. Instead of directly compressing in k-space, coil compression is performed separately for each spatial location along the fully sampled directions, followed by an additional alignment process that guarantees the smoothness of the virtual coil sensitivities. This important step provides compatibility with autocalibrating parallel imaging techniques. Its performance is not susceptible to artifacts caused by a tight imaging field-of-view. High quality compression of in vivo 3D data from a 32 channel pediatric coil into six virtual coils is demonstrated. Magn Reson Med, 2013. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
